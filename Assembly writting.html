I am here to deliver a speech and grab your attention towards the most important topic "Effects of Pollution on Humans".<br><br>
The problem of pollution has became very serious in today's world. Human interference is one of the major cause of pollution.
Human population has being increasing rapidly from past 12 years, increasing population of human is directly propostional to increasing pollution.
The main causes of of pollution are industries and automobiles. Industries made what we want them to make, they make everything that we use in are daily life.
Something does not cause that much pollution in the proccess of making but causes lots of pollution while we use it like cars, refrigerator, etc.
Therefore knowingly or unknowingly we are produce pollution, which in return causing damage to us only.  
Physical Effects pollution on humans are heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema and stress and deppresion are two effects of pollution on mental health of human.<br><br>
We can stop causing pollution by using alternative products to which we use today, may be some of alternative product cannot be that good as the original one but it will be cleaner and safer and in future you can pass on a beautiful planet to your grand children to live.
